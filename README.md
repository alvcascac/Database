# Database Assignment 2
The assignment is completed in groups of 2. You can also by exception choose to complete it individually.

**In the first part of the project you are expected to :**
- Normalize the relational model
- Update SQL statements for creating database according to normalized model
- Input example data (enough to demonstrate queries)
- Write relevant SQL queries for your database (covering all SQL statements, clauses and keyword presented in the lecture)

I suggest you use the same example and database environment as for part 1.
You deliver the assignment by showing the updated model and demonstrating a working database to student assistants during lab hour or group work hours.
